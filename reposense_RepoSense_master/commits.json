This may\r\nbe due to the Year 2038[1] problem. As the given until date is too\r\nearly (year 1950), this causes the time difference to overflow. As\r\nsuch, a future until date is formed instead, causing git log to give\r\nall the commit info, thus the test fails.\r\n\r\nAs a hotfix for this issue, let\u0027s set an earlier until date\r\n(year 2010) for the test instead.\r\n\r\nAs this check is also not within the scope of the test method,\r\ngitLog_sinceDateInFuture_noContent(), let\u0027s refactor it out to\r\na different test method, gitLog_untilDateBeforeAnyCommit_noContent.\r\n\r\n[1]: Description of the Year 2038 problem:\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem",
